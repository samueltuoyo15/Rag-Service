# 🤖✨ Gemini-Powered RAG Service ✨📚

Unleash the power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with this Go-based service! 🚀 This project allows you to upload files, ask questions, and receive insightful answers generated by Google's Gemini models. 🧠

## 🛠️ Installation

Get started with these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/samueltuoyo15/Rag-Service.git
    cd Rag-Service
    ```

2.  **Set Environment Variables**:

    *   🔑  Set your Gemini API key:

        ```bash
        GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
        ```

3.  **Run the Service**:

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

    *   ✅  The API will be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## 🚀 Usage

### Uploading a File and Asking a Question

1.  Send a `POST` request to `/api/upload` with the following:
    *   `file`: The file you want to process.
    *   `question`: The question you want to ask about the file.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:8080/api/upload \
  -F "file=@path/to/your/file.txt" \
  -F "question=What is the main topic of this document?"
```

2.  The service processes the file using RAG and returns a JSON response:

    ```json
    {
      "message": "Content has been generated successfully",
      "data": {
        "content": "The main topic of this document is..."
      }
    }
    ```

## ✨ Features

*   ❓  **Question Answering**: Ask questions and get AI-generated answers.
